### Link
- Live Site URL: (https://weixintoo.github.io/mini-webapps-project/timer/)

## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS (variables, flexbox, position, animation)
- Basic JavaScript

### What I learned
This is my first lightweight functional web app. This is actually part of a small project at the end of a YouTube Video I watched.
Takeaways:
1. Implement semantic HTML tags I learned.
2. Implement CSS animation to make webpage interesting.
3. Implement simple JavaScript DOM manipulation to update page as timer run in real time.

### Continued development
1. I would like to make the webpage responsive in most devices out there.
2. I would like to upgrade this web app into Pomodoro Timer in the future as a way to make my webapp a productive app.
